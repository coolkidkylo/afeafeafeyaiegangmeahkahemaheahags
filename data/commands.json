If a trainer says \"PTS is active\", they mean that you need permission to speak, before you speak. You can ask for permission by simply typing \"PTS\" in-game, and wait for a trainer to either grant or deny your request.\nSTS means Shoulder to Shoulder. This is most commonly used when asking members to go into the arena and STS. To get into STS, you need to put the shoulders of your avatar directly next to the shoulders of another members avatar.\nSFL means single file line. This means that everyone needs to get into 1 line.\n\nWhat are warnings? What happens if I get one?\n\nWarnings are used to make sure that nobody misbehaves during a training. You can recieve warnings for speaking without permission, not following orders, etc etc. If you receive 3 warnings, you will be asked to leave the training.\n\nWhat activities will there be in the training?\n\nIn a training, there are a variety of activities that you may see. It is entirely up to a trainer as to how many of these activities they will do, and which ones they will do. A list of common activities will be listed below.\nGladiator: 2 team captains will be chosen, who will create teams. These 2 teams will fight, however there is a twist. In gladiators, one member of team 1 will fight a member of team 2. If the member of team 1 dies, another member of team 1 will come down and immediately fight the member of team 2. If that member of team 2 dies, another member of team 2 will come down to fight. This will continue until one team has no more remaining members.\nTeam fights: In team fights, 2 team captains will be chosen to select teams. These teams will fight each other. Pretty self explanatory.\n1v1s: One person will fight another person, very simple.\nTrainings will be posted in #training-announcements.

For example, if someone sent a hateful message towards someone once, you shouldn't resort to a ban right away, instead you should talk with the person, and then determine what you should do. Now, most of the time, you won't ban right away. If someone is spamming, depending on the severity, you should warn or mute them. However, everything said here can vary based on how many times they do it.
